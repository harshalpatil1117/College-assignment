        The catalogue lists journal titles, but not the titles of the articles inside the journals. To find these you will need to search the recommended Chemistry databases

References recommended on reading lists will already have been evaluated for quality. You will need to evaluate sources that you find yourself. Think critically about the information you find. The quality of your information has an effect on the quality of your assignment.
